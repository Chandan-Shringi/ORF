# ORF

### Program to find out Open Reading Frames (ORF) from a DNA sequence.

This program takes a string of DNA sequence as input and gives all the possible reading frames within a SRART codon and STOP codon with the protein outcome (i.e. sequence of aminoacids) as output.

Output is also saved as a file named as "output.txt" .


Note: If the aminoacids sequence contain " \_\_\_start\_\_\_ " then it means that there is a start codon in between the sequence. Thus they can form two protein outcomes.
